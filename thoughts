use gjapi to store user data:
 - world (randomly generated?)
 - current deck, all cards
 - stats?
 
think about logging all games so that they could be reconstructed/mined

to acheive different screens:
- use jQuery ajax to load template files
	- battle screen (what I have now)
	- world screen
	- deck builder screen
	
multiplayer mode?


multiple backgrounds? (via css class)
